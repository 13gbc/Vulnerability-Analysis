# Vulnerability Write-Up: CiscoSmartInstall (CVE-2018-0171)

CVE ID: CVE-2018-0171
Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
Severity: Critical

## Vulnerability Details

CVE-2018-0171 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability that affects Cisco devices with a vulnerable Smart Install client. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code remotely without user interaction.

## Technical Overview

This vulnerability resides in the Cisco Smart Install feature, which facilitates the installation of Cisco switches. Attackers can send specially crafted Smart Install protocol messages to vulnerable devices, triggering a buffer overflow or memory corruption. This enables them to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

## Impact

The impact of CVE-2018-0171 is significant. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, and potentially compromise the targeted Cisco device. Compromised devices can be used to launch further attacks within the network.

## Identifying Vulnerable Systems

To identify systems vulnerable to CiscoSmartInstall (CVE-2018-0171):

1. **Check Cisco Devices:** The vulnerability affects Cisco devices with the Smart Install feature enabled.

2. **Smart Install Status:** Check if Smart Install is enabled on your Cisco devices. The command "show vstack config" can help identify its status.

## Identifying Vulnerability Internally and Over the Internet

### Internally:
- Use the Cisco Smart Install client audit tool to scan your internal network for vulnerable devices. This tool can identify devices with an open TCP port 4786, which is commonly associated with Smart Install.
- Command: `show vstack config`

### Over the Internet:
- Employ port scanning tools like Nmap to scan external IP ranges for open port 4786.
- Nmap Command: `nmap -p 4786 <target IP range>`
- Additionally, consider using Shodan to search for devices with open port 4786. [Shodan Search for CiscoSmartInstall](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A4786)
