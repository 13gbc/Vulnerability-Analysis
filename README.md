# Vulnerability-Analysis

Welcome to the vulnerability-Analysis-scripts repository on GitHub! This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts that are designed to help you gather information about vulnerabilities in different systems and software. These scripts can be useful for security researchers, system administrators, and anyone else who is interested in staying up-to-date with the latest vulnerability information.

Each script in this repository is designed to perform a specific task, such as querying a vulnerability database or scanning a system for known vulnerabilities. You can run these scripts on Linux or macOS systems that have Bash installed.

I encourage you to explore this repository and use these scripts to enhance your vulnerability research and analysis. However, please note that these scripts are provided as-is, and I cannot guarantee their accuracy or effectiveness. Use them at your own risk and always exercise caution when performing vulnerability assessments.

If you have any questions or suggestions for new scripts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate your contributions to this project and hope that it proves useful for your vulnerability research efforts.

These script do the following :
-querys the nvd database for specific details on a CVE
-checks if an Amazon S3 bucket exists, lists the objects in the bucket, and copies a file to the bucket.
-downloads files from a public s3 bucket, checks to see which ones are text files, greps keywords from the files and saves the results to a file
