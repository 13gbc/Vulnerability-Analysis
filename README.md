# Vulnerability & Scripts WritesUps

Welcome to my vulnerability Write Ups repository on GitHub! This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts that are designed to help you gather information about vulnerabilities in different systems and software as well as writups of key vulnerabilites.

I encourage you to explore this repository and use these scripts or writeups to enhance your vulnerability research and analysis. However, please note that these scripts are provided as-is, and I cannot guarantee their accuracy or effectiveness. Use them at your own risk and always exercise caution when performing vulnerability assessments.

If you have any questions or suggestions for new scripts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate your contributions to this project and hope that it proves useful for your vulnerability research efforts.
