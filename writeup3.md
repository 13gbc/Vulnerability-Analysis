# Vulnerability Write-Up: Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169)

The Shellshock vulnerability, identified by CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, emerged as a critical security threat impacting Unix-based systems. The vulnerability resides within the Bash shell, exposing systems to remote code execution and unauthorized access.

## Technical Specifics

Shellshock stems from the mishandling of environment variables in the Bash shell. Specifically, attackers can exploit the way Bash interprets maliciously crafted environment variables, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability opens the door for attackers to execute commands remotely, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the target system.

## Impact

The impact of Shellshock is far-reaching due to the widespread use of the Bash shell in Unix-like environments. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to execute commands, compromise sensitive data, and gain unauthorized control over targeted systems. The potential for exploitation is particularly concerning for web servers and services that use Bash in their execution processes.

## Identifying Vulnerability

To determine vulnerability to Shellshock:

1. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
    bash --version
   ```
The affected versions include but are not limited to:<br>

Bash versions 1.14 through 4.3: Vulnerable to CVE-2014-6271. <BR>
Bash versions 4.3 up to 4.3-025: Vulnerable to CVE-2014-7169. <BR>

## Mitigation

Mitigating the Shellshock vulnerability involves:

1. Patching: Update the Bash shell to a patched version that addresses the vulnerability.
2. Regular Auditing: Continuously monitor systems for vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.
3. Network Segmentation: Implement network controls to limit potential attack surfaces.
4. Security Updates: Stay informed about security advisories and updates from your OS vendor.
