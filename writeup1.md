# Vulnerability Write-Up: NTP Monlist Vulnerability

The NTP (Network Time Protocol) Monlist Vulnerability presents a critical cybersecurity risk for systems reliant on NTP. Despite NTP's crucial role in time synchronisation, the misuse of its Monlist command poses the threat of Distributed Reflective Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) attacks.

## Technical Specifics

This vulnerability stems from the design of the Monlist command, which allows attackers to request a list of the last 600 clients that have interacted with an NTP server. By manipulating the source IP, attackers redirect the server's response to the victim's IP, causing a surge in amplified traffic that overwhelms the victim's resources.

## Impact

The NTP Monlist vulnerability carries severe implications, empowering attackers to orchestrate high-amplification factor attacks. These attacks not only disrupt services for the targeted entity but can also harm other unsuspecting parties. Adversaries exploit NTP servers to execute significant attacks with minimal exertion.

## Attack Scenario

In a potential scenario, an attacker exploits the Monlist command, masking the victim's IP. The NTP server unwittingly transmits an extensive list of clients to the victim, intensifying the attack traffic. Consequently, the victim's network experiences downtime, financial losses, and reputational damage.

## Identifying Vulnerability on Ubuntu

Ubuntu users can assess their vulnerability using this method:
1. Open the terminal.
2. Enter the following command: `ntpq -c rv | grep monlist`

## Checking Vulnerability Over the Internet

To evaluate vulnerability remotely:
1. Utilise the `nmap` tool with a command like: `nmap -p 123 --script ntp-monlist <target>`

## Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Disable the Monlist command in NTP server configurations.
2. Regularly update NTP servers to the latest versions.
3. Implement network filtering to block unsolicited NTP traffic.
