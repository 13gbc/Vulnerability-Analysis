# Vulnerability Write-Up: BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)

The BlueKeep vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708) poses a critical security risk to Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS). This vulnerability exposes systems to remote code execution without user interaction, potentially enabling wormable attacks.

## Technical Details

BlueKeep is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation in Windows systems. Attackers can exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable systems. Successful exploitation provides them with the capability to execute arbitrary code and potentially compromise the entire system.

## Vulnerable Systems

BlueKeep affects the following Windows versions:

- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2008
- Windows XP (out of support but still in use)
- Windows Server 2003 (out of support but still in use)

## Identifying Vulnerability

To determine if your system is vulnerable to BlueKeep, follow these steps:

1. **Check Windows Version:** BlueKeep affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and their corresponding versions.

2. **Look for Updates:** Verify if the latest security updates and patches from Microsoft are applied to your system. You can do this by:
   - Opening the "Windows Update" settings and checking for updates.
   - Using the Microsoft Security Update Guide to search for the specific update related to CVE-2019-0708.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the BlueKeep vulnerability:

1. **Apply Patches:** Ensure your system is up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches provided by Microsoft.

2. **Network Segmentation:** Implement network controls to limit the spread of potential wormable threats.

3. **Consider Disabling RDP:** If Remote Desktop Protocol is not necessary, consider disabling it to reduce the exposure of vulnerable systems.

4. **Update Legacy Systems:** If you're running legacy systems like Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, consider upgrading to supported Windows versions.

5. **Regular Vulnerability Scans:** Perform regular scans of your network to identify and address any systems that might still be vulnerable.
