**Vulnerability Details:**
Title: Clear Text Transmission Vulnerability in Telnet
CVE ID: CVE-XXXX-XXXX

**Technical Overview:**
Telnet, a legacy protocol used for remote terminal connections, is plagued by a critical security vulnerability due to transmitting data in clear text. Operating over port 23, Telnet lacks encryption, enabling attackers to intercept sensitive information, including login credentials and commands. This vulnerability has contributed to the propagation of malware like Mirai, which exploits exposed Telnet services to compromise and control IoT devices.

**Impact:**
The impact of this vulnerability is profound, as attackers can exploit the unencrypted communication to capture sensitive data. Compromised information such as usernames, passwords, and confidential commands can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential exposure of intellectual property. Organizations relying on Telnet for remote access are at risk of data leaks, reputation damage, and financial losses.

**Identifying Vulnerable Systems over the Internet:**

1. **Shodan:** Attackers leverage Shodan (https://www.shodan.io/), a search engine for internet-connected devices. To identify Telnet-exposed systems, an attacker can use the query "port:23." This search will reveal devices with open Telnet ports that are accessible on the public internet.

**Example Shodan Query:**
```
port:23
```

2. **Network Scanning with Nmap:** Attackers can employ network scanning tools like Nmap to identify systems with open Telnet ports.

**Example Nmap Command:**
```sh
nmap -p 23 --open -sV <target_IP_range>
```
3. **Masscan: Masscan** is a fast network scanner that can quickly scan a wide range of IP addresses and ports. It can be used to identify open Telnet ports across a large IP range.

**Example using Masscan:**
```sh
masscan -p 23 <target_IP_range>
```
**Mitigations:**

1. **Transition to Secure Protocols:** Replace Telnet with secure alternatives like SSH (Secure Shell), which encrypts data transmission, rendering eavesdropping difficult. OpenSSH (https://www.openssh.com/) is a popular and secure replacement.
